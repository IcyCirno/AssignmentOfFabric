This is an assignment showcase where we use what we’ve learned to build an art protection, trading, and gaming platform. Here, you can choose to be an artist and upload your works, which will be protected on our platform. Players can use the platform-issued currency to randomly mint cards, with the card faces displaying the artists’ works. Each card has random attributes and unique effects. To create different factions, we allow players to trade cards, enhancing the strategic possibilities of offense and defense. All card and transaction information is guaranteed to be traceable and authentic by Fabric.
